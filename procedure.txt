Layout: Design a layout that is confusing and hard to navigate. For example, you could place navigation links in unexpected places, use inconsistent styling, or make important information hard to find.

Colors and Fonts: Use clashing colors and hard-to-read fonts. You could also use inconsistent font sizes and colors.

Interactive Elements: Add forms, buttons, and other interactive elements, but make them behave in unexpected
Animations: Use animations, but make them slow, distracting, or annoying. For example, you could make an important piece of text slowly scroll across the screen, or have pop-ups that can't be closed.
Content: The content should be hard to read and understand. You could use long, complex sentences, or jargon that your audience won't understand.
